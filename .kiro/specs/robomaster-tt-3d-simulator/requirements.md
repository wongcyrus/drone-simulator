# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive 3D simulation environment for RoboMaster TT drones that accurately mocks the actual UDP API. The system consists of a web-based 3D visualization using Three.js, a Python backend with WebSocket support, and mock drone clients that receive UDP commands and translate them into visual actions. The simulator supports multiple drones simultaneously and provides real-time visualization of drone movements, states, and telemetry data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer testing RoboMaster TT applications, I want a 3D web-based simulator that visually represents multiple drones, so that I can test my drone control code without physical hardware.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the simulator is launched THEN the system SHALL display a 3D environment with a coordinate system and ground plane
2. WHEN multiple drones are added to the simulation THEN each drone SHALL be visually distinct and identifiable
3. WHEN a drone moves in the simulation THEN the 3D visualization SHALL update in real-time to reflect the new position and orientation
4. WHEN viewing the 3D scene THEN users SHALL be able to rotate, zoom, and pan the camera to observe drones from different angles

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a RoboMaster TT developer, I want the simulator to accept the same UDP commands as real drones, so that I can use my existing control code without modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a UDP command is sent to a mock drone client THEN the client SHALL parse the command according to RoboMaster TT protocol specifications
2. WHEN receiving movement commands (takeoff, land, go, curve, flip) THEN the mock drone SHALL execute the corresponding action in the 3D simulation
3. WHEN receiving setting commands (speed, rc) THEN the mock drone SHALL update its internal state accordingly
4. WHEN receiving read commands (battery, speed, time) THEN the mock drone SHALL respond with realistic simulated telemetry data
5. WHEN an invalid command is received THEN the mock drone SHALL respond with appropriate error messages matching real drone behavior

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a Python backend server with WebSocket communication, so that mock drone clients can communicate drone state changes to the web-based 3D visualization in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Python backend starts THEN it SHALL create a WebSocket server that accepts connections from the web frontend
2. WHEN a mock drone client updates its state THEN it SHALL send the state update to the Python backend via API calls
3. WHEN the backend receives a drone state update THEN it SHALL broadcast the update to all connected WebSocket clients
4. WHEN the web frontend connects THEN it SHALL receive the current state of all active drones
5. WHEN multiple clients connect simultaneously THEN the backend SHALL handle concurrent WebSocket connections without data loss

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer testing multi-drone scenarios, I want to simulate multiple RoboMaster TT drones simultaneously using different UDP ports, so that I can test swarm behaviors and coordination algorithms on a single machine.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting multiple mock drone clients THEN each SHALL listen on a unique UDP port (e.g., 8889, 8890, 8891) to simulate different drone IP addresses
2. WHEN commands are sent to different drone ports THEN only the targeted drone SHALL respond and execute the command
3. WHEN configuring the simulator THEN users SHALL be able to specify custom port ranges and drone identifiers
4. WHEN multiple drones are active THEN the 3D visualization SHALL display all drones with distinct visual identifiers and port labels
5. WHEN drones move simultaneously THEN the visualization SHALL update all drone positions and orientations in real-time without performance degradation
6. WHEN a drone is added or removed THEN the visualization SHALL dynamically update to reflect the current drone count

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want realistic drone physics and movement simulation, so that the simulator accurately represents how real RoboMaster TT drones behave.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a takeoff command is executed THEN the drone SHALL gradually ascend to hover height with realistic acceleration
2. WHEN movement commands are executed THEN the drone SHALL move with appropriate speed limits and acceleration curves
3. WHEN a flip command is executed THEN the drone SHALL perform a realistic rotation animation
4. WHEN a land command is executed THEN the drone SHALL descend smoothly to ground level
5. WHEN battery simulation is enabled THEN battery level SHALL decrease over time based on drone activity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive telemetry data simulation, so that I can test applications that rely on drone sensor readings and state information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying drone speed THEN the system SHALL return current velocity in x, y, z directions
2. WHEN querying battery status THEN the system SHALL return a realistic battery percentage
3. WHEN querying flight time THEN the system SHALL return accumulated flight duration
4. WHEN querying temperature THEN the system SHALL return simulated temperature readings
5. WHEN querying attitude THEN the system SHALL return current pitch, yaw, and roll values
6. WHEN mission pad detection is simulated THEN the system SHALL return appropriate mission pad coordinates and IDs

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy setup and configuration of the simulation environment, so that I can quickly start testing without complex installation procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing the simulator THEN all dependencies SHALL be clearly documented with installation instructions
2. WHEN starting the system THEN configuration files SHALL allow customization of drone count, starting positions, and simulation parameters
3. WHEN launching multiple drones THEN the system SHALL automatically assign available UDP ports
4. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN it SHALL be available on a configurable port with clear connection instructions
5. WHEN errors occur during startup THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance
